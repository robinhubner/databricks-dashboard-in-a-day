    "## ☕ Story Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010 — the very same year **Databricks** was founded — a small team of coffee enthusiasts opened a café on **Market Street, San Francisco**.  \n",
    "They called it **Sunny Bay Roastery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, they were just another boutique coffee shop, but their obsession with precision, data, and quality soon made them a local favorite.  \n",
    "Every espresso shot was logged, every bean batch recorded — long before “data-driven coffee” was even a buzzword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next decade, Sunny Bay grew to five stores across the Bay Area.  \n",
    "Then, in 2020, when the pandemic hit, foot traffic dropped overnight. The company had to pivot — fast.  \n",
    "Online coffee bean sales exploded as people became **home baristas**, experimenting with grinders and brewing ratios while stuck at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, in 2025, Sunny Bay Roastery stands at a crossroads.  \n",
    "Its CEO, **Mr. Bean**, wants to understand:\n",
    "> “What really drives our coffee sales?  \n",
    ">  How do seasons, holidays, and online vs. in-store trends shape our future?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the company’s data is scattered:\n",
    "- Some comes from old **in-store point-of-sale systems**.  \n",
    "- Some from **e-commerce logs**.  \n",
    "- And some from **Excel files** sitting in Mr. Bean’s inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve just been hired as the company’s first **Head of Data & Analytics**.  \n",
    "Your mission: **build a unified data platform** that can turn these fragments into insight — and prepare Sunny Bay Roastery for its next phase of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, you need to set up your workspace in Databricks to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Questions You’ll Help Answer in the Coming Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this workshop, you’ll explore Sunny Bay’s data and help Mr. Bean uncover the answers to key business questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which days of the week generate the highest coffee sales — and why?**  \n",
    "2. **How did COVID-19 impact store vs. online performance?**  \n",
    "3. **Which product categories are most profitable in each season?**  \n",
    "4. **Can we forecast future demand based on historical trends and holidays?**  \n",
    "5. **How can we combine BI dashboards and AI predictions in one workspace?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Each lab builds on the previous one.  \n",
    "You’ll progress from *raw data integration* all the way to *machine learning–enhanced business intelligence*.  \n",
    "And along the way, you’ll help Mr. Bean make Sunny Bay Roastery one of the most data-savvy coffee brands in the world ☕🚀."
