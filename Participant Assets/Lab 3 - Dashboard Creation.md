# 🧪 Lab 2 – Creating an AI/BI Dashboard

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Use a Databricks Metric View as the primary semantic source for dashboard visuals.
- Build interactive AI/BI Dashboards including charts, filters, drill-downs, and summary tiles.
- Add and configure global filters (e.g., date, store, product) to make dashboards fully interactive.
- Use AI-assisted visual creation to accelerate dashboard building with natural-language prompts.

## Introduction

**What Are AI/BI Dashboards?**

Databricks Genie is an AI-powered, natural-language interface that lets business users ask questions about their data in plain English and get back answers as tables, charts, and summaries without writing SQL or building reports first. It sits on top of governed datasets like Unity Catalog metric views, so all insights respect existing security, governance, and business definitions.

With Genie, teams can:
- Go beyond static dashboards and get on‑the‑fly answers to new questions that weren’t pre-modeled in reports.
- Self‑serve insights using conversational prompts, reducing dependency on data engineers and analysts for every new question.
- Rely on consistent metrics and semantics defined in Unity Catalog and the Genie knowledge store, improving accuracy and trust in results.
