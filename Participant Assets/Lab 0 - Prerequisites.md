## ☕ Story Setup

In 2010 — the very same year **Databricks** was founded — a small team of coffee enthusiasts opened a café on **Market Street, San Francisco**.  
They called it **Sunny Bay Roastery**.

At first, they were just another boutique coffee shop, but their obsession with precision, data, and quality soon made them a local favorite.  
Every espresso shot was logged, every bean batch recorded — long before “data-driven coffee” was even a buzzword.

Over the next decade, Sunny Bay grew to five stores across the Bay Area.  
Then, in 2020, when the pandemic hit, foot traffic dropped overnight. The company had to pivot — fast.  
Online coffee bean sales exploded as people became **home baristas**, experimenting with grinders and brewing ratios while stuck at home.

Today, in 2025, Sunny Bay Roastery stands at a crossroads.  
Its CEO, **Mr. Bean**, wants to understand:
> “What really drives our coffee sales?  
>  How do seasons, holidays, and online vs. in-store trends shape our future?”

Unfortunately, the company’s data is scattered:
- Some comes from old **in-store point-of-sale systems**.  
- Some from **e-commerce logs**.  
- And some from **Excel files** sitting in Mr. Bean’s inbox.

You’ve just been hired as the company’s first **Head of Data & Analytics**.  
Your mission: **build a unified data platform** that can turn these fragments into insight — and prepare Sunny Bay Roastery for its next phase of growth.

But first, you need to set up your workspace in Databricks to get started.

### 🔍 Questions You’ll Help Answer in the Coming Labs

Throughout this workshop, you’ll explore Sunny Bay’s data and help Mr. Bean uncover the answers to key business questions like:

1. **Which days of the week generate the highest coffee sales — and why?**  
2. **How did COVID-19 impact store vs. online performance?**  
3. **Which product categories are most profitable in each season?**  
4. **Can we forecast future demand based on historical trends and holidays?**  
5. **How can we combine BI dashboards and AI predictions in one workspace?**

Each lab builds on the previous one.  
You’ll progress from *raw data integration* all the way to *machine learning–enhanced business intelligence*.  
And along the way, you’ll help Mr. Bean make Sunny Bay Roastery one of the most data-savvy coffee brands in the world ☕🚀.
